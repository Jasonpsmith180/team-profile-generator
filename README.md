# Team Profile Generator

## Description

This is a Team Profile Generator app! When you are working in a team it helps to have a profile of everyone on the team and their roles, so to streamline that process I made an app!
The app starts out by asking the user about the Team Manager. It gets their name, employee id, email and office number. The app will then ask if the user wants to enter an engineer or intern, or finish the profile.
If the user chooses engineer or intern, the app will again ask for the name, employee id, email and github account for engineers or school for interns. Once the user has finished entering all of the team members and chooses to finish the profile an HTML file is created in the dist directory with all of the information formatted into cards with links to emails and githubs for engineers.
